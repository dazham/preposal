# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO

- A food ordering system that will have a menu, a discount system etc.
- A  aim trainer using that will generate random circles in a window for user to click on and score points in a time limit
- A personal blog site using html and css

My plan is to mostly use things I have learned so far for the project from python and maybe see if I can implement some outsider stuff that was not in class. I will also have the idea of creating a personal website though I have heard that understanding css is really tough.



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO
- No plans to collaborate yet, I will likely do it on my own

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO
- I would like to make the aim trainer but I am not sure to what extent I can use outside information like I know it would require me to use tkinter but I have not used it before, am I allowed to use other's work like youtube tutorials to achieve this.

- Similar question for css, I have discovered tailwind, will I be allowed to use such tools - tailwind, from my understanding, has some pre-made css that I can use but I can also customize and what not.
