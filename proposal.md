# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

    Personal Blog Site Using HTML And CSS


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

    It will be a minimal themed blog site, where I can post about different things like a trip, a project, stories etc.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

    The blog site will be a simple and clean website built using HTML and CSS, possibly with light use of JavaScript later. It will include a home page with links to individual blog posts, an about page describing me and the purpose of the blog, and a contact page. Each blog post will have its own sub pages, containing text and possibly images. I will create and organize the pages manually using HTML for structure and CSS for layout and design.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

    Not Applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

    - All the intended pages for the website
    - CSS looks nice and visually appealing
    - Some javascript implementation
    - Ability to have pictures and videos into the blog pages

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

    My next steps are to create an intial plan of how I want my website to look like - designing it properly with headers, sections, links to the blog sub pages. And then working on the new skills : learning html and css. I plan to use youtube tutorials to learn them. And then, for the topics to research will be - how to use css libraries and implementing them into my website, how to implement videos and photos into my website, and lastly how can I host my website.
